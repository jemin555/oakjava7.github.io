OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) Programming Language is invented by wilmix jemin j at year 2013,2016 in java(jdk1.6) ,DOTWEB3.0. and OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) is a World Rank A' Programming Language and it is focused on creating DataStructures,Console Application with Wnosql DB, and used in web application and Used in Remote X application and it has Advanced Oops.But OakJava7 windows application is present in JDollarShell not present in OakJava7(JAVA7.0). OAKJava7(JAVA7.0) has Advanced concept like Bucket,Extend,etc. But in JdollarShell only J$Shell GUI,Graphics are found. Remote X application is Advanced than Python,Webapplication,and all programming Languages.So Say Good bye to olden web application.

It is used in Remote X application which is not opensource.Because Remote X application is different from webapplication and this concept is invented by Wilmix Jemin j.This Remote X application and Remote web Application are not one. Remote web application is advanced than remote X application. This Remote X Application and Remote Webapplication is confidental from illegal hackers or another illegal persons who want to copy all my features in their research product and they will implement it.

It also supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it is Learnable.It is easy to learn. JAVA7.0 means Jemin Advanced Virtual Application. JAVA7.0 is even Advanced than Python Programming language and all programming Languages. OakJava7(JAVA7.0) Linux version is implemented in C/C++, Java,Dotweb3.0 at year 2021.

Definition:
â€œJAVA7.0 is meant for obfuscation, Code Security, Learnable, Prototype software, Advanced , used in Software development, web application with machine learning , and it symbolizes
STAR symbol, used in applications like consolee and used with java/j2ee framework like Struts, spring , hibernate ,etc and JAVA7.0 is used in Machine Learning and Datascience ".

The Meaning of OAKJAVA7 or JAVA7.0 is OAK + Jemin Advanced Virtual Machine OAK gives the meaning Beginning.

ABOUT JAVA7.0
JAVA7.0 Programming Language is otherwise known as OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) which is invented by wilmix jemin j at year 2013 in java ,DOTWEB3.0. This two versions of JAVA (Jdk1.8,jdk1.7) failed that is using JAD decompiler we can
easily take the source code.. But using oakjava7 we can't take the code. We felt thanks to my best friends venkat friend , github , and all for their support..

ADVANTAGES of JAVA7.0(OAKJAVA7)

a) JAVA7.0 behaves like his parent java and  Dotweb3.0

which java fails completly in code security. 

b) JAVA7.0 supports Garbage collection and explicity memory.

c) JAVA7.0 support Multiple inheritance ,friend function, and operator overloading

and all C/C++ oops concepts.

d) JAVA7.0 also supports CDollar concepts.

e) JAVA7.0 also includes C# oops concepts.

f) JAVA7.0 also follows attractive syntax.

g)  OakJava7(JAVA7.0)   provides  High  Security when compared to all the  programming  languages.

h) Since it had  100% oops concepts it is ranked as NO:1

Top quality software according to wilmixsolomonresearch lab.

i) JAVA7.0 is used with JDollar,CWEB section, C#, and with all writ Programming languages.

j)  JAVA7.0  also  provide   Shortest  function Statements  ...

k)  JAVA7.0  is  easy   to  learn  and  focus  . ie) it  is  Learnable  Programming Language...

l)  JAVA7.0   also  had  his   own  shell  prompt  known  as  Java7Shell...

you  can  execute and  run  Java7.0 Programs...

m)  Java7.0  also   focus  on Code  Security.

n)  Java7.0  is  an interactive  Programming Language..

ie)  It  is  used   with  Java  ,  C#  And  other  writ  Programming Languages .. 

Java  and C#  professionals can  easily  focus. 

o)  JAVA7.0  is  focused on MachineLearning,Datascience  ,etc.

p)  JAVA7.0  is  used  with  WNOSQL  Database which  provides  high   security...

q)  JAVA7.0  is used  with  WXML  which  is  very  easy   to  create   Forms ,Reports,etc.It avoids

typing  html  everytime.  

r) JAVA7.0  also   supports   100%  OOPS  concept. So  it  is called as  a  Pure OOPS  Programming Language.

s)  We  can   convert   Java program  to  Oakjava7  Program  by   using  command  ConvertToJava7.

t)  OakJava7   Intermediate Program    is  used   to  test  the  OakJava7  Program  , when  user

done  mistake  in OakJava7 Programming. 

u) OakJava7    is  designed   in such  a  way   that  Java  Programmers  can   easily   follow it.

v)  OakJava7  is  best  in security  side. eg)   when  we use  Machine learning or web application, it  is best  in security side.

w)  OakJava7   will  work  in  Linux  platform like  ubuntu, etc. So write once  and  run any where.

x)  OakJava7   can  be used  with  Java Frameworks like  Java spring , Hibernate,  Mybatics.

so  we   can  call  OakJava7  as an  interactive  programming Language.

y) OakJava7  is  Good  for  the  Interviewer  to  select  a  rightful candidate.

Z)  To Write  OakJava7  program for  any task it will take  only few  minutes  or

if  it is  a miniproject  we  can  finish  the  mini project  with in 1 hour.

Thus  OakJava7  Programming Language is very  easy, it  saves  time and  cost. So it  is a user friendly  Programming Language.

AA)  OakJava7  Programming Language also compile and  run  the  file  like .web

and .java7   at the same time  using   javap7.exe. 


Note: OakJava7 has more advantages than i given above..

ABOUT OAKJAVA7 with MachineLearning and Datascience History
J@ framework from J$part2 focused for Mathematical statistics and Datascience. and such concept is removed already and updated in oakjava7(Java7.0)... and now only mathematical statistics concept is now found in j@ at JDollarpart2.. So J$ give his concept to Oakjava7. Now JDollar(J$) real rank is Rank z'''.
So JDollar(J$) use machine learning and datascience before python uses machine learning and datascience. Jdollar(J$),oakjava7 and all other writ programming language is not concenterated in AI and creating robots.

Why Oakjava7 is the best and top programming language than python p.l?
i) Both Oakjava7 and java/j2ee is like english fluent language.

but python is not a english fluent language.

ii) Using Oakjava7 we can reduce the lines of code.

python is not easy for the developers to focus when it reduce the lines of code...

iii) Oakjava7 and Java/j2ee follow camel case and can be adjusted at any style with beautiful arrangement

using Intellij.But Python is failed in indentation.

iv) OakJava7 is an beautiful programming language with attractive syntax and with few lines of code than python programming Language.

v) OakJava7 module Oakjava8 is best in Mobile computing.



Note:
As only 45% of JAVA7.0(OAKJAVA7) features is published for professionals but many features of oakjava7(JAVA7.0) is hidden from users.. Since they may copy the features and try to implement it...

Oakjava7 is not released now. It has no bugs. OakJava7 will come at any time that you don't expect it. In Oakjava7 first version itself we will cover 70% the concepts of Machine learning and DataScience. and remaining concepts will be covered in OakJava7 second version.

About the OakJava7 Programming Language
========================================
Note: I spent 5 years to Design and create the Oakjava7 programming language. but unwanted hackers attack my website without any reason. That's why iam delayed. Oakjava7(JAVA7.0) programming language is not easy to design and invent it. To invent Oakjava7 programming language is very hard... Oakjava7(JAVA7.0) programming language is the technology wisdom given by God jehovah to me.

Who may focus OakJava7(JAVA7.0) ?
For Oakjava7 ,oakjava7 machinelearning,oakjava7 datascience only C or C++ or C# & Dotnet or Java/j2ee

Professionals or Google Professionals can focus and read the samples. Because it is designed like this.

Note: All oakjava7 documents are under construction.So don't read it now ,because it will confuse you.
And all are done but iam working for Oakjava7 pdf documentation and OakJava7 scroll webapplication / Single Webapplication.

Important Note:
==============

      <h1>Welcome to  OAKJAVA7  Programming Language FAQS! </h1>
      <p>


<u>4WH Questions?</u>


</p>

<br>

<p>

<u>

 
1) What  Are  the  Merits  of  using  OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0)  Programming language?
</u> </p>



a) JAVA7.0 behaves like his parent java and JDollar

java fails completly in code security. so JAVA7.0 is widely used

in the world instead of java.

but java(jdk1.8,jdk1.7) is used with JREE in linux platform.

b) JAVA7.0 supports Garbage collection and explicity memory.

c) JAVA7.0 support Multiple inheritance ,friend function, and operator overloading

and all C/C++ oops concepts.

d) JAVA7.0 also supports CDollar concepts.

e) JAVA7.0 is used to create games which cannot be achieved in cdollar and gdollar.

f) JAVA7.0 also includes C# oops concepts.

g) JAVA7.0 also follows attractive syntax.

h) Since it had  100% oops concepts it is ranked as NO:2

Top quality software according to wilmixsolomonresearch lab.

i) JAVA7.0 is used with JDollar,CWEB section, C#, and with all writ Programming languages.

  4) What  are    the   demerits   of  JAVA  and  C#?</u>

</p>
<br>

DEMERITS  of JAVA and  C#
=======================

a) JAVA  class  file   has  many demerits  so  any thing  you create  a compiler  in  java
the source  code  can  be  easily  taken  by JAD.

b)  C#  (.exe  or  .dll)  source code can  also  be  taken  using  any code  reflector available  in  google site.
That's  why   JAVA7.0  is  focused. So Creating software  in C#  is  useless.
JAVA7.0 is a  OAKJAVA7 for creating  datastructures   and    compilers.
JAVA7.0  accepts  ".java"   filename  and  translate  to  .class file.
that  java  is  said  to  oak  java  different  from  orginal java; which  is   not understood  by hackers.
JAVA7.0  loads    .dll in   memory  to create  a  Prototype  software.
